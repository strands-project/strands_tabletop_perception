This classifier relies on object shape and is based on the approach of W. Wohlkinger and M. Vincze *Ensemble of Shape Functions for 3D Object Classification".

It uses CAD data for training, such as https://repo.acin.tuwien.ac.at/tmp/permanent/Cat200_ModelDatabase.zip.

In order to speed up training, please select a subset of the training data you want to use and put it in a folder `Cat200_ModelDatabase__small`.

The classifier can then be started by:

`roslaunch openni_launch openni.launch _depth_registration:=true`
`roslaunch object_classifier classifier_demo.launch models_dir:=your_dataset_dir/Cat200_ModelDatabase__small/ topic:=/camera/depth_registered/points`
