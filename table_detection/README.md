table_detection
==============

This package uses the `primitive_extraction` package to extract planes and determines which of the planes are tables
based on size, angle with respect to floor, shape and height above floor. A list of detected tables is kept locally
and in the `mongodb_store` and new tables overlapping with old ones are merged by finding the common convex hull.
All currently found tables can be found by querying all `strands_perception_msgs/Table` from the `mongodb_store`.

The table detection is launched by:

`roslaunch table_detection detection.launch cloud:=/pointcloud2/topic`,

where `/pointcloud2/topic` is a point cloud in the frame of reference of a global map. Currently, the package outputs
three visualization topics in RViz:

* `/primitive_extraction/primitive_marker_array` - All detected planes from the last processed point cloud as `visualization_msgs/MarkerArray`.
* `/table_detection/primitive_marker_array` - All detected tables from the last processed point cloud as `visualization_msgs/MarkerArray`.
* `/primitives_to_tables/table_markers` - Tracked tables that have been determined to be new instances or merged with an old one, published as `visualization_msgs/Marker`.

The launch file has a bunch of options and parameters, notably for determining what is a table:

* `min_height` - Minimum height of a table plane.
* `max_height` - Maximum height of a table plane.
* `max_angle` - Maximum deviation of table normal from straight up.
* `min_side_ratio` - Minimum ratio of shortest side divided by longest side.
* `min_area` - Minimum area of table plane.
