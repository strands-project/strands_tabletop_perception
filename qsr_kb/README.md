# QSR KB and Visualisation 

Knowledge representation of and reasoning about QSRs using SWI-Prolog. Specialized predicades can be used to visualize QSRs in RVIZ.  

## Starting the KB service

First the knowledge base service has to be started:
```
roslaunch qsr_kb kb_bringup.launch
```
(Please note that SWI-Prolog needs to be installed; on Ubuntu run: `sudo apt-get install swi-prolog`)

The knowledge base service provides a simple *tell and ask* interface to a Prolog engine. Queries and answers are exchanged using strings.

## Adding knowledge about QSRs to the KB


## Querying knowledge about QSRs from the KB and visualise the result.
