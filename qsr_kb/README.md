# STRANDS QSR Knowledge representation, reasoning and visualisation 

Knowledge representation of and reasoning about QSRs using SWI-Prolog. Specialized predicades can be used to visualize QSRs in RVIZ.  

## Starting the KB service

First the knowledge base service has to be started:

```
roslaunch qsr_kb kb_bringup.launch
```

The knowledge base service provides a simple tell-ask interface to a Prolog engine. Queries and answers are exchanged using a `string`.

## Adding knowledge about QSRs to the KB


## Querying knowledge about QSRs from the KB and visualise the result.
